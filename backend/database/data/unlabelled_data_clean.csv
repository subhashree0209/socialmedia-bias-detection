The Protestors should be carrying American flags not foreign ones.,KriosDaNarwal,/r/centrist/comments/1l6fgu9/the_protestors_should_be_carrying_american_flags/,"I'm not American but we on the internet should all be familiar with their ""Truth, Justice and the American way"", ""Land of the Free"" etc. Thats what their flag represents to their population and it would be a powerful image in response to the overuse of military force. Even the most murican, American would be struck by those images, much like they were in the depths of their civil rights movements and later race riots etc. Using foreign flags kind of ""legitimizes"" the ICE mandate to their supporters and some moderates, in that it gives the right wing talking heads easy, visual things to point at and throw as much filth as they can. A common comment I already see is "" oh you're using the flag of the country you're running from?"". Not saying those are *good* points by any means but they are **EASY** points the right wing media will latch unto and use to de-legitimize the protests."
I deeply regret my vote for Trump,Dinocraftman009,/r/centrist/comments/1meje71/i_deeply_regret_my_vote_for_trump/,"Voting for Trump in 2024 was the greatest mistake of my entire life. I am 19 years old and this was my first presidential election. I don’t stand by or condone what the administration has done and never was a hardline far-right conservative, sure as hell am not now. I walked into the polls in November without honestly knowing which candidate I would choose since I was very on the fence about both sides (Pro-2A, pro-life, but also pro-environment and pro-Ukraine). Now I wish that I hadn’t voted at all, much less Trump. Don’t try and rationalize my decision in your head, because it wasn’t rational. I did not properly weigh the potential pros and cons of the candidates. There aren’t any dots to connect, I flat out made the incorrect decision.

I feel evil. I feel like a horrible, selfish, foolish person. And there’s nothing that can really be done to remedy this mistake. I’ve already decided to vote a full blue ticket in 2026 but that doesn’t fix what damage has already been done to this country. In our democracy, we give our small amount of political power to people who we believe deserve through that ballot. I need to take accountability for that ballot because, even though my state was a safe red one this season, I’m ultimately a part of it.

Alienating our closest allies is stupid. Cutting PBS and the NWS is stupid. The tariffs are stupid. The blatant disregard for the Constitution is stupid. Detaining and deporting people without due process is stupid. Supporting Israel is stupid. Not siding with Ukraine and trying to exit NATO is stupid. Cutting education funding is stupid. All the warning signs were spelled out in Project 2025 + Trump’s personal life + Jan 6 and my dumbass disregarded it, instead wanting change from the previous administration. I knew damn well and I hate it. What pushed me to the red side of the fence was that Harris was the status quo candidate and ultimately I wanted change. But boy we sure as hell did get a lot of change. This populist line of thinking is dangerous and has proven to be in the past. 

I’ve been beating the shit out of myself about it ever since that day and it’s been difficult to genuinely enjoy most aspects of life with looking at the headlines. I, along with tens of millions of other Americans, made a massive mistake in November and so many innocent people are paying a price far greater. I personally feel responsible for every idiotic decision, as well as the future decisions, our President, Congress, and SCOTUS send out/approve, like a twisted knife. The mental and emotional wounds will remain even after this all blows over.

Why post here? I don’t want to be associated at all with people who somehow still support our idiocracy. I also don’t want to take part in the partisanship that is tearing this country apart, and my conscious would have probably broken me from the amount of shame and guilt I’ve harbored since November had I kept it any longer. I want to follow an ACTUAL centrist line of thinking, which is why I’ve been closely looking at this subreddit.

Also, humility is gonna require some humiliation, so I fully expect and understand that this is going to lead to a lot of unkind words sent my way. Righteously deserved, I’ll probably agree with what most of you have to say. 

The confession is worthless without a pledge to change. I was wrong. So unfathomably wrong. (Yeah no shit OP, is what I imagine is cycling through most of your heads by now). And I want to amend for this. If I don’t take accountability, I’m not going to see the change through. I want to be better. I’m voting all Democrat in 2026. I hope we all do too, especially those who also regret their ballot cast. And I hope that I won’t regret these votes as much I regret my past one."
I regret voting for Trump,[deleted],/r/centrist/comments/1jl8jse/i_regret_voting_for_trump/,"So , alot to get off my chest and the fact that I can get it off is weird to me, but bear with me. But I'll make sure to use bullet points. I also have weird apologies I apologizem

 I'd consider myself a  right leaning independent. I think of both parties have  MAJOR issues (honestly two party system sucks). 2020 I voted for Biden , 2024 voted for trump. 

Why I voted for trump 
- at the time I felt like I was in a position of voting for the best of two really bad option economically. The economy was (is ) in shambles. I felt if I was voting for Harris the status quo would continue with the economy continuing to shrink. The last administration she was apart of , wasn't doing anything to fix it and just wanted to print more money (like pumping water out of a ship) to fix the problem instead of patching the economic issues causing the leaks.

We are single income family , my wife is a SAHM who can't work due to illness so this was a huge issue for us 

- I felt at the time anything major that he would try to do would that was not in the best interest of the United States would be stopped. THATS THE whole point of checks and balances! (At least that was what was taught to us in college and highschool) 

- I honestly believed that he did have the best interest and that most of the ridiculous and stupid things he was saying , were either sarcastic or had no weight to it. He said stuff like that all the time last time he was president and nothing came of anything. It was all a mues to him to get the media riled up. 

- the lack of trust in the media and past overreactions online.    
This one is kind weird to say( type out) because this has been in my head and to actually tell anyone this is weird. I'm not a conspiracy nut or anything like that so no (the media is not out to get anyone). But I do feel in the past the media and or internet world would and still does overreact to anything he did. To the point a majority of the right and some of us center would drawn it out and or in some MAGAs I know would overreact the opposite. Kind of like a boy who cried wolf situation. Except the wolf became wolfish to meet what the media and world had made him out to be. Ever since 2016 things have always been blown out of proportion, so by 2025 9 years later I almost felt numb to anything that was being said. I recently deleted my Facebook because it was nothing by over blown reactions and opinions from both sides of the isle. MAGAs believing that trump was some how a savior to all mankind (which as a Christian is sickining, especially due to how many other brothers in Christ believed this ifykyk). To friends on the left constantly since 9 years ago saying he is literally the modern (mean mustach failed art student) and that even you voted for him you are a literal (supporter of mean mustach man) and you should just die. And would constantly pull at straws to match that opion.

 We are at a spot now things are happening and their like I told you so....I get upset thinking no you didn't you just kept throwing stuff at the fan until something went through and stuck and you went "" first try..... ""

Why I regret voting for him 

- economicly why somethings are cheaper we are in the cliff of a complete collapse. We have in the time of 3 weeks almost eliminated all trade with the rest of the world and especially Canada (this is big in the next point)

- we have isolated and gotten rid of every ally we have  which is scary (literally destroyed 75 years of trust in weeks) . The Canadian one is especially hard for me because I live 13 mile from the border in western NY upstate NY and western NY have more in common with the Toronto metro and Canada then we do with NYC and the northeast cordore. I live in a port city on lake Ontario were trade with Canada is huge ships come in multiple times a week for grain and other shipments. Plus driving to Canada and Canadians coming to us was not a big deal we supported each other because we were neighbors and friends and family. Ever since this stupid trade war, im afraid of what Canadians think of us and me. I worry if I go to Canada like I do in the past and they see a ny plate they might judge me or target me for something that I wanted nothing to do with.  Its gotten to the point were If I see a Canadian on the road (often) I'm as nice as possible to them driving just because I feel bad what he has done.

- he is somehow going around the checks and balances. The very thing that would keep him from doing things so drastically. He is simply going around with no to little push back from anyone and dismantling and or joking of dismantling the very checks and balances that exist. 

- while he is cutting spending , which is good instead of welding the hole of the ship (per last analogy) he seems to have taken a stick of TNT and blown the decks away inside the ship and using that steel to fix the holes.... Creating new gashes and missing  sections in the very ship. 

- I'm scared for my family's future. I fear for the economy without global trade how will I be able to afford to provide for my family if there is nothing to provide them with. He is going nuclear on goods but honestly there is not enough made in the US to support ourselves without trade.

- the nation is split more then ever now. Everyone seems to be at each other's throats and I'm worried it's only going to get worst now. How will people treat others who voted for the opposite party? Will everyone just assume I'm a maga even though I disagree with most of everything the believe in?

Other thoughts 

How will people see me in the future will we have worst case scenarios where you are judged and or your path of opertunuty or escape is by who you voted for. Like my mind races say something bad we're to happen is my family going to be judged for my decision that I made for in November? If I were to travel to Europe for a vacation or go to Canada ( like I loved to do for my birthday) how do I respond if someone ask me who I voted for?

How will others see me as a Christian if they knew who I voted for? How does that reflect on Christ now. They see the horrible things trump did and the ""Christians"" who say it's in the name of God when often it doesn't reflect biblicaly at all. But will people immediately think we'll I want no part of that if that's what Christianity is like. 

How will my daughter see me in the future will she be mad at me for the very decision I made that day. 

Do I not have to feel bad because my vote didn't count anyways being from NY so electoraly it still went to kamila? 

I'm have tempted to write to my congressional representative asking to somehow work with Canada trade and economicly. How would that even work?!?

Feel free to discuss all this Im just confused and needed to get thoughts out on page. If this goes nowhere and noone sees this then at least I got it off my chest writing it out. 

.............

UPDATE:

 To clarify a lot of questions and or remarks.

1. I was totally/am a misinformed voter. I realize that hence why I came here. I want to be better, I NEED TO BE BETTER. 

2. I Am very real just a very dumb person trying to learn from his very stupid mistakes. (I know rare for the Internet world but it happens from time to time) I want to learn from my mistakes and be better here on out. 

3. To all the Canadian folks on here I just want to tell you the amount of Canadian flags flying here is awesome and we love y'all. I pass so many on my way home.

"No, this sub hasn’t gone left.  MAGA just decided we weren’t relevant.",Kaszos,/r/centrist/comments/1k1gl52/no_this_sub_hasnt_gone_left_maga_just_decided_we/,"If your main grievance here is that this sub is too anti-right, you have your head in the sand. This is the lightest way I can put this. 

Conservatives currently control all the main levers to power. That is a fact. The Executive, the Judicial and the legislature. 

The main issues that are impacting people today are from one side. 

* Tariffs, who’s pushing them? 
* Deportations? Who’s the driver of these?
* First amendment issues… who are the main sources spurring outcry? 
* Who currently has the largest backing of wealth? 
* Who’s the one ignoring the courts? 
* Who’s the one gutting social programs? 

As centrists our duty is to preserve the middle at all costs. That INCLUDES at times the need to anchor one side with a stronger pull. THAT is an obligation we must not neglect. A stronger pull centre requires strong anchors. Without these, we’re nothing.

Mahmoud Khalil does in fact support terrorism,Maleficent-Sir4824,/r/centrist/comments/1jc3m10/mahmoud_khalil_does_in_fact_support_terrorism/,"I'm frustrated by the discourse around this on this sub and others, and the frankly very dishonest reporting on this by most media outlets.

Mahmoud Khalil is absolutely a supporter of terrorism. This really is not up for debate. He holds a formal position among the leadership of CUAD, an explicitly pro Hamas organization who has self described it's goal as ""the total eradication of Western Civilization"" through violence and who in the same statement said that they looked to ""militants"" like Hamas for instruction. CUAD regularly holds pro Hamas protests and passes out pro Hamas fliers which contain inspirational quotes from Hamas terrorists who have killed Jewish civilians. 

Here is a video of Mr. Khalil two days before his arrest, making a speech at a CUAD meeting in which he calls Hamas and the Oct 7th attacks ""legitimate armed resistance.""

https://imgur.com/wzZqLuD

Here are some of the fliers that CUAD passes out on the regular:

Here is an article about CUAD's ""eradication of Western civilization"" statement:

https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/09/04/we-must-choose-liberalism-over-illiberalism/

Here is CUAD's substack, which includes an eulogy for Sinwar, among with quite a lot of other overt terrorism support:

https://cuapartheiddivest.substack.com/

Here are some videos of Mr. Khalil at CUAD organized protests:

https://x.com/CampusJewHate/status/1898081410415837481

Mr. Khalil has acted as a negotiator on behalf of CUAD for well over a year. He acted as a negotiator during the building takeover of Hamilton Hall last spring, during which a janitor was kidnapped. He again acted as their negotiator during CUAD's second building takeover on March 6th, during which several Columbia personnel were assaulted and the entire Barnard campus had to be evacuated due to bomb threats.

There's also a lot of misinformation going around regarding due process and the law. Firstly, Mr. Khalil was arrested in public, on the street, where ICE does not need a warrent. He was not ""dissappeared"" but is being held at Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center. He does not have to be convicted of a crime in order to be deported. He only has to violate the terms of his greencard, and that includes support for terrorism.

It's true that a judge had to block his immediate deportation, in order for Mr. Khalil to recieve a hearing in front of a judge. This is not due to a violation of due process. A greencard holder does not actually have the right to a hearing in front of a judge when accused of supporting terrorism by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. While I don't think this is very fair, it's important to note that this process has been in place for 73 years, and many people accused of supporting terrorism have been deported under it. I do think it is interesting that the first time there is an outcry about it is when an open supporter of antisemitic terrorism is about to be deported. 

None of the information listed above is a statement on my or anyone else's political beliefs (aside from Mr. Khalil's). It is not a statement on what has been going on between Israel and Palestine. It is simply relevant information, that shouldn't be twisted to fit a narrative to prove some broader political point. 

For the record, I am a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris. But that really should not be relevant, because the facts I put together above are true regardless of the political beliefs of the person saying them. I have been very alarmed recently at the way many otherwise reasonable people have reacted to the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil and the way that facts have been lost and sometimes actively buried amongst the discourse, in a way that feels very MAGA adjacent. I've been repeatedly accused of being a MAGA nut on various subs, for bringing up the information I've listed above. So I'll just repeat one more time: the facts listed above aren't political statements. They are reality. We can't lose grip on reality because we want to prove some point about Donald Trump. That really makes us no better than the MAGA cult and I'm tired of seeing reality play second fiddle to political narratives."

Trump is such an idiot who has no regard for this country and its citizens.  He is only doing Russia's bidding to weaken the West and democracy so that authoritarians can rule.  Personally, I'm going to start the *Christian Democratic Party* which will align a Christian worldview with the Democratic Party ideals of community, freedom, liberty, loving our neighbors, and helping the poor.

None of this is productive. None of this is based in fact, or rational in any way. The only goal is to spread anger and fan flames. In person, the Conservatives I know were all saying ""I can't believe people are celebrating this"", and they're right. It's insane. But at the same time they're completely dismissive against attacks that happened towards those on the left recently. All it is about anymore is having a sense of moral superiority.

Breaking News from NYT,CleverNombre,/r/centrist/comments/1m7l46z/breaking_news_from_nyt/,"Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in the spring that his name appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files, according to three people with knowledge of the exchange.

The disclosure came as part of a broader briefing on the re-examination of the case by F.B.I. agents and prosecutors. It was made by Ms. Bondi during a meeting that also included the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and covered a variety of topics. Ms. Bondi frequently meets with Mr. Trump to brief him on various matters, officials said.

Ms. Bondi and Mr. Blanche informed the president that his name, as well as those of other high-profile figures, came up in their re-examination of documents connected to the case that had not previously been made public. Mr. Trump, a friend of the disgraced financier, has already appeared in documents related to the investigation. Appearing at the White House in February, Ms. Bondi distributed a series of binders about the Epstein files with the phone numbers of the president’s former wife and his daughter in them.

“As part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings,” Ms. Bondi and Mr. Blanche wrote in a statement in response to questions about the briefing. “Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution.”

Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, would not address questions about the briefing, but called any suggestion that Mr. Trump was engaged in wrongdoing related to Mr. Epstein “fake news” and said Mr. Trump ejected Mr. Epstein from his club, Mar-a-Lago, for “being a creep.”

Department officials have regularly informed some White House officials about developments in the inquiry. Such communications are permissible under the law.

The conversation was reported earlier by The Wall St. Journal.

One person close to Mr. Trump, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that White House officials were not concerned about the latest disclosures given that Mr. Trump’s name appeared in the first round of information that Ms. Bondi released."

I never realized how much of an echo chamber Reddit is until October 7th happened,[deleted],/r/centrist/comments/1jq9gzj/i_never_realized_how_much_of_an_echo_chamber/,"I’ve always been firmly on the left.

I am an American Jew, and I’m sure you can imagine where this is going. Suddenly, my comfy leftist bubble didn’t feel so comfy anymore. For the first time, I had a viewpoint that not only the majority of Reddit disagreed with, but vehemently disagreed with, and that was tied to the very core of my cultural identity. 

I read many comments with a sinking feeling in my stomach. I even tried to rationalize it. Maybe *I’m* wrong. Maybe my culture is nothing but colonizers, maybe I am just a dirty ~~Jew~~ Zionist. It’s not like there’s been tension in the Middle East for decades with both sides hating each other. It made me really depressed, to see a platform that I 100 percent trusted and felt like I belonged in turn against me.

I still don’t agree with mostly all conservative viewpoints, but damn, now I know how it feels. I kinda admire conservatives who still post here even though they will get downvoted. It’s hard to stick to your beliefs when you get so much hate. It’s broken me out of whatever loyalty I thought I owed to the left. 

Edit: I’ve been reading many comments and want to say a few things. I don’t have a blind allegiance to Israel either. I acknowledge the Israeli government is doing messed up things. I’m talking about people who want to eradicate the entire state of Israel and believe Jews have no right to the land. I’m talking about the very aggressive “Go back to Poland” people. "
The US is currently under the most criminal administration we've ever seen.,ComfortableWage,/r/centrist/comments/1j10xzi/the_us_is_currently_under_the_most_criminal/,"I have never been more ashamed to be a US citizen in my life. We let Trump, a traitor, criminal, and rapist convicted felon waltz into the Oval Office like we didn't give a shit. And he's now proceeding to literally destroy our government and checks and balances.

Not only that, but it appears that crime is totally fine now so long as you're rich. Tate brothers just got released even though they should be rotting in prison. Our government fought to release known money launderers and sex traffickers. 

Trump is colluding with Russians. He is harming our relationships with all of our allies while taking a massive shit on the US citizens he's hurting the most. 

They're about to release the Epstein files and guess whose name won't be in them? Yep! You guessed it... Trump's name will be completely erased but I'm sure Biden or the names of their ""enemies"" will somehow make it into the file instead.

I'm beyond fucking disgusted. America is a disgrace. And MAGAts don't care that they caused this to happen."
Why is the “ceasefire now” crowd silent?,DarkEsteban,/r/centrist/comments/1o1j7as/why_is_the_ceasefire_now_crowd_silent/,"You have a deal that has the backing of all relevant parties involved, including Israel, the US, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt. A deal that would remove Israeli presence from Gaza, end Hamas as a military organization and create an internacional peacekeeping force that would pave the way for the establishment of a new Gazan civil government that does not involve Hamas. So why are all pro-Palestine celebrities, politicians, journalists and activists - that kept pressuring for a ceasefire when it would benefit Hamas - suddenly so silent? Why aren’t they publicly pressuring Hamas to accept this deal?

Edit: Hamas has just now accepted the deal, and many here are claiming there’s no need to pressure them anymore. They have agreed to phase 1 of the deal, the release of hostages and withdrawal of the IDF. The next phases include Hamas disarmament and an arab peacekeeping force to allow a Gazan civil government. Without those next phases there’s no long term peace, so the need for international pressure still remains, especially to protect Palestinians who spoke out against Hamas."

And then to make it worse added some dressed up math symbols that basically equated to 1 times 1 is 1 and tried to pass this crap off to the American people.

He is using so called emergency powers to start trade wars with foreign countries that did as he requested and removed their tariffs and then he still put tariffs on them.

Why would you tell them they played it wrong if you were trying to negotiate or beat the..

It's truly gross. It's modern day slavery. Undocumented workers are often treated poorly, taken advantage of, and used for cheap labor. And to hear liberals defend modern day slavery while calling people racist for wanting to deport criminals IS INSANE. 

Finally, being against illegal immigration isn't being racist. Because illegal isn't a race! Yet when liberals hear illegal they picture a single race. THAT is racist. They're the ones thinking in racial terms instead of legal terms. It's so gross.

It's time to take accountability.,Magehunter_Skassi,/r/Conservative/comments/1mabbpg/if_you_voted_for_donald_trump_everything/,"Donald Trump has told us who he is for decades now, he's told us what he's planned to do, and so has his inner circle. If you didn't know what you were signing up for in 2016, maybe you did just get swept away in the hype and weren't fully cognizant of his entire platform. But 2024 was his third campaign. You knew. You've known for years.

You knew that Trump would give $45 billion dollars to ICE and lay the groundwork for mass deportation.

You knew that Trump would dismantle entire federal agencies and end almost all foreign aid.

You knew that Trump would end DEI initiatives.

You knew that Trump would renegotiate trade deals to prioritize Americans over our allies.

You knew that Trump would pull us out of UN organizations.

You knew that Trump would defund NPR, PBS, and left-wing universities.

You knew that Trump would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving free cosmetic surgery.

You knew that Trump would send the Marines to stop lawless protests.

You knew that Trump would pressure companies to remove artificial dyes and replace corn syrup with sugar.

You knew that Trump would bring border crossings down to their lowest number in history.

It's easy to point towards Trump and go ""it's his administration, he's the one doing it""-- but it was only possible because YOU voted for him. He didn't just win the election, he won the popular vote. Even if you lived in a ""safe blue state"", your vote has made his administration feel like they have a nationwide mandate to advance every single item on its agenda.

Struggling with the Lib Dem stance on immigration,person_person123,/r/LibDem/comments/1mb36a8/struggling_with_the_lib_dem_stance_on_immigration/,"I agree with many of the Liberal Democrat values and policies, however, when it comes to immigration, I’ve found myself more conflicted in recent years - and in some ways, more sympathetic to what other parties are saying.

There’s a lot of media coverage (both social and mainstream) around immigration, especially illegal immigration or stories linking migrants to crime or strain on public services. I understand much of this is sensationalised or agenda-driven, and I try not to take it at face value. But even with that in mind, I feel like some of the concerns aren’t just a media spin.

I live in the South East, near London, where immigration is high, and I’ve genuinely noticed how some areas have changed. I don’t mind multiculturalism, in fact, I value it, but I’ve noticed that there seems to be limited integration. For example, streets full of shops with only Arabic/romanian/etc signage and no english at all, or ethnic enclaves where they don't even attempt to integrate at all, as well as language barriers - I dislike British expats who can't be bothered to learn the local language and I apply that logic to people who move here as well.

At a statistical level, I know immigration numbers aren't necessarily exploding, but they’re concentrated in particular regions, and that changes how it feels. There’s real pressure on housing, schools, and NHS services, and it’s hard to stay pro-immigration when the everyday reality seems to highlight only the costs, not the benefits.

Additionally, YouGov.co.uk had an interesting study showing how ethnic minoritys tend to vote in the UK (2024). It revealed that they voted for labour mainly, then in order, conservatives, green, REFORM, and then finally libdem - we are advocating and campaigning for people who vote for parties like reform more than us. This likely also stems from the fact that we support LGBT+, gender equality, and secularism more than other parties - all of which arent that popular with Muslim immigrants.

Is it time for the LibDems to reassess their stance on immigration to reflect the current state of the country, or am I simply becoming disillusioned by what I see locally?"
"6 of our MPs spoke on the self ID debate, all 6 spoke un favour of trans rights. Some really incredible speeches here",theendisloading_uk,/r/LibDem/comments/1kqpj0v/6_of_our_mps_spoke_on_the_self_id_debate_all_6/,"In total 6 Lib Dem MPs spoke in the debate: Dr Roz Savage MP, Charlotte Cane MP, Vikki Slade MP, Gideon Amos MP, Pippa Heylings MP &amp; Christine Jardine MP 

Gideon Amos MP only gave a short intervention, but the other 5 spoke passionately about trans rights and spoke out in opposition to the EHRC and Supreme Court.

They gave direct quotes from trans people, and many of them such as Dr Savage worked with trans people in preparing their speeches.

Last time I came here, your rightly called me out for not brining the official party voice. So here, I've shipped a few key quotes from our MPs which detail just how the Liberal Democrats really feel about the supreme court ruling, the EHRC and trans people.

I really hope this can reassure you that the party is FIRMLY on the side of the trans community, and the wider LGBTQ+ community:


Dr Roz Savage MP:

&gt; Let us take the example of Joelle, a trans woman who died of an eminently treatable cancer after waiting for eight days on a general ward, because clinicians could not agree whether she should be placed on a men’s ward or a women’s ward. The delay in treatment cost her her life. That is not to mention the recent Supreme Court ruling and the devastating impact that its implications are having on trans people, who are just trying to get on with living their lives.

&gt; I am keenly aware of the distress that the Supreme Court ruling has caused. It seems to fly in the face of common sense when somebody who is clearly living life as a female would, under this ruling, have to go into male spaces. It beggars belief. The ruling hurts not only trans people, but any woman who does not conform to feminine norms, who may be challenged on entering a women’s space. This is not just a legal roll-back for trans rights, but a roll-back for women’s rights.

Charlotte Cane:

&gt; However, the EHRC almost immediately issued guidance that was unworkable and did not respect the rights of trans people, and we all understand that it will be contested legally. If a trans woman cannot use women's toilets and should instead use other toilets, what is she supposed to do? If she uses the gents, she risks abuse and assault. If she uses the disabled toilet, she takes up a facility that others might need. This is a major imposition on a person’s life. When they want to travel, go to the theatre or go to a sports venue, they face the challenge of what they are going to do if they need the toilet. How can we be doing this to people? It is outrageous. One woman facing this dilemma told me: “Since the ruling, I have seen a flood of hate. I have lost friends to suicide, and I have friends struggling to survive. Public life brings social anxiety. For example, this Friday I am travelling to Manchester. This is my first long trip away from home since the ruling, and it scares me. If I use female toilets, I could be apprehended, I am sure I would not, could not use the men's toilets, and ‘disabled’ toilets also expose me, if they are available. During my transition, I had several ‘situations’ including assault, and I thought this was all behind me. Going back to a life of fear in public is something I will struggle with and would do everything to avoid.” We cannot allow this to continue. It is not acceptable. One of our core functions as MPs is to ensure people’s safety, and we are not ensuring the safety of trans people.

Vikki Slade MP:

&gt; The recent Supreme Court ruling has made life as a trans person so difficult, and calls into question the value of a gender recognition certificate. If trans people who have undertaken all that is required to achieve that status are still to be treated as though they remain in the sex that they were assigned at birth, what is the point of a gender recognition certificate? Self-ID seems to be the only viable alternative. If self-ID is not to be progressed, what assurance can the Minister give our trans constituents that a gender recognition certificate will become easier and quicker to attain? If a trans person has gone through many years of distress, treatment, cost and trauma, they deserve to be honoured and respected, and their legally acquired gender should be recognised.

Pippa Heylings MP: 

&gt; Ireland, Denmark, New Zealand and Argentina have all reported positive administrative and public health outcomes from policies based on legal gender self-declaration. As we have heard today, these nations are not collapsing and the sky has not fallen in. They are modernising, but in the UK we continue to ask trans people to navigate a legal process that is, according to the Government’s own consultation, dehumanising, overly bureaucratic and prohibitively expensive. We continue to ask trans people to prove that they are ill in order to access the legal right to live as their authentic selves. That contradiction is not only outdated, but harmful.

I’m a British Muslim of Asian background and I honestly don’t know what to make of this anymore.

My best mate of 30 years has completely changed over the past year or so. He used to be a Tory, but now he’s all-in with Reform and parrots Trump/Farage talking points. Since then, his views have gone down a really dark road:

	•	He’s bought into the Great Replacement theory, convinced the white race is under threat.

	•	He pushes assimilation over integration — basically saying everyone in Britain should act the same and ditch their own cultures. Quoting ‘When in Rome, do what the Romans do’.

	•	He’s openly Islamophobic, claiming Islam is “incompatible with British values.” He even attacked my sister for practicing her faith, calling her “conditioned.”

	•	He thinks asylum seekers shouldn’t have any rights.

	•	He supports collective punishment of minorities — e.g. stop and search for all Black people because of knife crime, or blanket monitoring of Pakistanis based on media scare stories.

	•	He’s said Hitler “had a point” about preserving culture and even justifies eugenics.

	•	He hides behind “freedom of speech” to excuse racism. According to him, if someone calls me a paki I should just “toughen up” and not be offended.

	•	He’s openly anti-trans, saying abuse of trans people is “justified.” In his words: “If a man wears a wig, they are not a woman.” He also thinks children shouldn’t be taught about any family types other than “man and woman.”

	•	He doesn’t believe in multiculturalism — despite being a second-generation immigrant himself and having a mixed-race son.

	•	He’s obsessed with “preserving Christianity” even though he’s an atheist.

Unsurprisingly, this has destroyed our friendship. Whenever I push back or call out his racism and bigotry, he flips it on me — calling me a “radical” or a “left-wing looney.” He insists “the majority agree with him” and treats me like I’m insane for standing up for basic human rights and freedom of religion.

The irony is he isn’t white himself, and when I point out that he’s benefited from living in a liberal country — marrying a white woman, having better career opportunities, and not facing the discrimination our parents’ generation did — he dismisses me like it’s all in my head.

It’s heartbreaking. This is someone I’ve known since childhood, and I feel like I don’t even recognise him anymore. Has anyone else lost a close friend to this kind of far-right radicalisation? It really feels like Farage and Reform rhetoric are tearing people apart who used to live side by side just fine.

Why I’ve resigned my membership after 11 years,chrisrwhiting46,/r/LibDem/comments/1o5gfg7/why_ive_resigned_my_membership_after_11_years/,"I’ve been a member of the Liberal Democrats since 2014. I’ve never voted for any other party. I’ve been internally elected within the party, and over the years I’ve written in national media outlets defending it. For a long time, I truly believed the Lib Dems were the political home for people like me: those who saw freedom and equality as inseparable, who believed in radical social liberalism as a force to expand opportunity and dignity for everyone.

That belief kept me loyal even when the party was struggling. I never saw the Lib Dems as a centrist halfway house between Labour and the Conservatives. I’ve always abhorred centrism. To me, liberalism was never about managerial moderation; it was about transformation - about redistributing power, wealth and opportunity so that people could actually live freely.

Last year, I read The Wolves in the Forest from the Social Liberal Forum, and for the first time in a while, I felt genuinely re-energised. The essays in that book spoke to the kind of politics that first inspired me: a bold, radical, compassionate liberalism that takes inequality, democracy and the climate crisis seriously. I recognised myself in those pages, and I thought maybe, just maybe, the party could find its way back there too.

But it hasn’t. In fact, it feels like it’s moving further and further away. What used to be a movement with purpose now feels like a hollow operation obsessed with affluent rural constituencies and a kind of safe, poll-tested inoffensiveness. The party I joined wanted to challenge power. The party today seems terrified of doing anything that might disturb it.

I can’t escape the sense that the Lib Dems have become more about comfort than conviction. While the country faces deep social, economic and environmental crises, the party is content to play within its middle-class bubble - too cautious to lead, too timid to speak to the scale of what’s happening. It’s become a spectator in a time that demands courage.

For years, when people asked me, “What’s the point of the Lib Dems?”, I had an answer. I would go on about liberal values, fairness, civil rights, redistribution, Europe - the works. I believed all that, deeply. But now, I genuinely don’t know what the point is anymore.

This party has been part of my political identity for most of my adult life. But I can’t keep supporting something that’s lost the very thing that made me believe in it: the courage to be radical, moral and truly liberal.

I didn’t leave because I’ve stopped believing in liberalism. I left because I do."
"Ed Davey backs Rayner, saying as fellow parent of disabled child he accepts she was prioritising her son's care needs",upthetruth1,/r/LibDem/comments/1n7gixh/ed_davey_backs_rayner_saying_as_fellow_parent_of/,"The Lib Dem leader **Ed Davey** has issued a statement supporting Angela Rayner in the controversy about her underpaying stamp duty. Like Rayner, Davey has a disabled child, and he says he is prepared to accept that in this case Rayner was acting in the best interests of her son.

(Rayner did not pay the full stamp duty owed when she bought a flat in Hove because, having put her stake in her previous family home in a trust on behalf of her son, she thought that it no longer counted as her property for stamp duty purposes.)

Davey said:

&gt;I understand it is normally the role of opposition leaders to jump up and down and call for resignations – as we’ve seen plenty of from the Conservatives already.

&gt;Obviously if the ethics advisor says Angela Rayner has broken the rules, her position may well become untenable.

&gt;But as a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son’s care after we have gone, so I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here.

&gt;Perhaps now is a good time to talk about how we look after disabled people and how we can build a more caring country.

Some observations:

As expected, the ambition bar is low:

&gt;So let me tell you – in confidence – our secret first target for the next general election. Our first target is to win more seats than the Conservatives

He rightly acknowledges that the country wants change, however there isn't a lot of substance about that, in particular on the economy. The LibDems, he says, must show and can show that that they are the only ones who can fire up the economy again. But that is a weird turn of phrase: he **is** the LibDems in this context. A confident leader would say ""the LibDems will"", not ""the LibDem must/can show that..."". The way he puts it, it sounds like he is trying to convince himself.

So this is the plan to achieve economic growth:

&gt;there is no serious strategy for restoring economic growth that doesn’t involve rebuilding Britain’s relationship with Europe.

&gt;And beyond Europe, we have set out plans to form a new economic Coalition of the Willing to stand up to Trump’s tariffs – not only with our European neighbours, but Commonwealth allies like Canada and other like-minded nations across the globe.

&gt;To take control of our own economic destiny, instead of waiting anxiously for the next rambling Trump press conference.

&gt;And then there’s our plan to cut energy bills in half by 2035 – making sure everyone feels the benefits of the cheapest forms of electricity: wind and sun. Helping families, pensioners and businesses with energy bills out of control due to gas prices and failed Tory energy policies.

This sounds, I'm afraid, vague, insufficient and too far out into the future to really cut through with the electorate (let alone be a credible plan).

The points about care - both social care, health care and care as solidarity, are positive and make the party stand out from the opponents, as is the principled, fair handed positioning on Palestine; and the uncompromising rejection of Trump and Farage's values (although one may say that by overmentioning them in a speech that is all about you might be an undeserved gift to them).

But all the inspired appeals sound vacuous if the ambition is merely to win more seats than the Tories, the plan for change remains vague, and the wording signals lack of self confidence."

""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""

It was a Nazi salute full stop.,manoteee,/r/Liberal/comments/1i6u113/it_was_a_nazi_salute_full_stop/,"Some have defended Elon’s Sieg Heil at the White House as being a ""Roman salute."" Right. Even some very liberal people are tired of hearing the Nazi comparisons. I strongly agree, and when these men stop acting like Nazis, we can stop making the comparisons.  
  
Fascism is a virus that exploits a decent person’s good nature and desire for patience and understanding. It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that’s not already obvious). Patience and “understanding” are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language; its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot “wait it out,” as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn’t tied to a single person or party—though it often prefers the right—it will inhabit whatever host isn’t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal—like Satan.  
  
Four hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice. In fact, “spits on” is an understatement; it’s the biggest “fuck you” I can imagine being made to a veteran of that era.

The Republicans are about to destroy the entire US healthcare system,Zargoza1,/r/Liberal/comments/1ksx0m9/the_republicans_are_about_to_destroy_the_entire/,"Rural hospitals get on average about 20% of their revenue from Medicaid, with some even higher. About 20% of discharges be it to skilled nursing faculty, long term facilities, or even home health are covered by Medicaid.  If you add in Medicare, the number jumps to greater than 50%.

Most of them are operating on a razors edge of staying open, with many closures even under current conditions.

A reduction of 5% of revenue is not feasible in a lot of communities.  A reduction of 20% would be catastrophic. The vast majority of rural hospitals would close.

Here is why it matters even to larger communities and hospitals.  Even the largest academic centers still get a portion of their funding from Medicaid. Losing that funding would likely not result in closure, but would result in cutbacks in staff and services.

With no local hospitals, people in all of those communities would have to go to the large hospitals for services. ER, inpatient and outpatient services would be overwhelmed quickly. 30+ ER wait times will become the norm. Boarding inpatients in the ER for days at a time will become the norm. The patients will be sicker, as a lot people who could have been easily treated will wait much longer for care and will be much sicker, requiring more and longer treatment.

Rural ambulance services will close. They depend on Medicaid for a large portion of their revenue as well. That and a 2 hour transfer to the closest hospital both ways for even the simplest hospital transfer wouldn’t be feasible either.

Nursing home and rehabs will close. They depend on Medicaid for a portion of their revenue. They also depend on local hospitals for simple things such an an X-ray after someone falls. It’s difficult to run a facility when if a resident falls, there is no ambulance service to transport a patient and no hospital in a 100 mile radius to transport them to. Without the skilled facilities to accommodate hospital discharges, inpatient stays will be prolonged in an already overstressed system.

In a lot of communities the healthcare system is one of if not the largest employer. All those jobs will vanish.

If this big beautiful bill passes and becomes law, the healthcare system will collapse. I know that the Medicaid cuts are phased, not immediate, but even small cuts could have devastating consequences that will have ripple effects across the entire system.

It will hit deep red rural areas the quickest and hardest, but the system isn’t build to absorb that damage. "

I believed everything they told me, and they played a key role in establishing my worldview.

That all changed on January 6, 2021. It became clear in the aftermath of that tragedy that Trump had made up a pack of lies about the election being stolen, and had engaged in criminal conduct to hold onto power. I assumed at that point that right-wing media would stop supporting him.

Boy, was I wrong! They only doubled down in their support for him, even allowing him to use them as a bully-pulpit against his political rivals in the 2024 primary. I decided at that point I was done with right-wing media, and when the Republican party re-nominated Trump, I decided I was done with it too.

Since escaping the right-wing media bubble, I've come to realize what an alternate reality universe it is. In this fantasy land tax cuts pay for themselves, conservative judges aren't activist and rule strictly according to the Constitution, Democrats are communists who hate America, and Trump is the true American patriot come to save it.

Of course all of that is B.S., but it gets ratings, and it explains why millions of people will support Trump, no matter what he does. They need to be brought to understand that right-wing media is not news in any objective sense of the word, but rather propaganda designed to push a political agenda. Its pundits have no journalistic standards whatsoever, and they and their guests routinely omit and misrepresent facts to create their false narratives.

So cultish has their devotion to Trump become that they excuse his crimes and blatant Constitutional violations, thus making them complicit in his authoritarian takeover of the country.

Another egregious crime of right-wing media is the use of selective facts, and even outright lies, to stir up hared against migrants and trans people. As a result, their listeners are just fine with masked agents kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps and stripping transgender people of any rights whatsoever.

Because it aids and abets criminality and fascism and spreads disinformation, right-wing media poses a clear and present danger to the Republic. I'm so glad I finally escaped from it, and everyone else should too."

"At this point, based on direct evidence, how much exactly in dollars has Elon Musk saved taxpayers by eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse in the federal government (i.e. not just his/Trump's quotes, but direct evidence of specific dollar figures)?",mr_bothsides,/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1iqykxa/at_this_point_based_on_direct_evidence_how_much/,"And as a secondary question, what direct evidence is there that Musk exaggerated or was flat out wrong about fraud, waste, and abuse he claimed existed?

I've largely spent the past couple days combing through social media and the news surrounding Elon Musk's DOGE, and I have to say it's absurd how hard it is to actually verify all the claims that both sides are making in this debate. It's honestly beyond frustrating how much time it takes to attempt to be informed, and I think it's a real problem for our democracy that quality information is so hard to come by.

**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the ""Musk and Trump's are eliminating fraud, waste and abuse side""**

DOGE has done everything it could to shut down USAID, and it does seem that USAID made some questionable spending decisions (among doing some quality work as well). First, it seems they were at least negligent in preventing funds intended for aid for ending end up in the hands of terrorists such as Hamas in Palestine, the Taliban in Afghanistan, [Source](https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/04/biden-admin-terrorist-1-3-billion-trump-foreign-aid/) and Al-Qaida in Syria. [Source](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/7283?utm_source=chatgpt.com). To be clear, this happened over the course of multiple administrations, not just Biden's.

Secondly, they gave millions for different projects to an organization called Eco Alliance, before ceasing the grants when the organization was ultimately found to have run research with a lab with Wuhan, China without proper oversight. [Source](https://oversight.house.gov/release/breaking-hhs-formally-debars-ecohealth-alliance-dr-peter-daszak-after-covid-select-reveals-pandemic-era-wrongdoing/?utm)

Third, USAID did use American taxpayer funds to develop DEI initiatives abroad, including $1.5 million in Serbia for advancing DEI and economic empowerment for LGBTQI+ people [Source](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200) and $2 million for an organization that funds gender affirming care and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights in Guatemala. [Source](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/realigning-foreign-assistance-with-american-interests/7953297.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (you can argue whether this was waste/abuse, but it was done).

USAID's budget is roughly $40 billion, so you could make the case shutting it down saves taxpayers this amount - whatever we spend on foreign aid through any replacement mechanisms (foreign aid can still be distributed in other ways, like by the State Department, so it's almost certain even if USAID was totally shut down the savings would be less than $40 billion).

**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the ""Fake news/exaggeration by Musk/Trump about fraud, waste and abuse"":**

DOGE eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but according to their records, the CFPB has gotten back nearly $20 billion for American consumers who were defrauded or taken advantage of by corporations ([Records](http://consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/enforcement-by-the-numbers/)).

Musk and Trump have also claimed USAID and other federal agencies were stealing $8 million a year from taxpayers, and giving it to Politico to write positive stories about Democrats. However, Politico has provided evidence that the fees were merely subscriptions that both Republican and Democratic policy makers had with the outlet ([Article](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5290282/politico-subscriptions-usaid-x-musk-trump)).

On top of that, Musk has claimed that DOGE discovered FEMA decided to give $59 million to house immigrants in luxury hotels, instead of providing hurricane relief to Americans. But people pointed out these funds were publicly authorized by Congress separate from any disaster relief funding, and only distributed FEMA in accordance with Congress’s orders ([Post](https://x.com/David_J_Bier/status/1888976312456417373) and [Law](https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ47/PLAW-118publ47.pdf)) In other words, DOGE didn't discover anything and this was Congress’s decision not FEMA’s. And FEMA officials have said the amount spent on standard and temporary housing for migrants was $19 million in accordance with Congress’s direction. On top of that, they note 13,000 North Carolinian households stayed in hotels FEMA paid for after the hurricane, and 3,000 still remain in those hotels ([Press Release](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20250207/north-carolina-153000-families-receiving-fema-help?)).

**I'm curious what others have found on both sides of this debate. It feels like it take a village to curate the news these days, and this seems like a community that is dedicated to that sort of noble effort. Please let me know what you've found!**

Its [tasks are limited,](https://www.kcra.com/article/trump-shut-down-department-of-education-heres-why/62887479) because education in the United States is largely funded at the state and local level.

&gt; But federal funding typically accounts for roughly just 10% of all school funding because the rest comes from state and local taxes.

The incoming Trump administration has a stated goal of eliminating the department.

What are the goals and legality of US President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs?,nosecohn,/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1jq3q1v/what_are_the_goals_and_legality_of_us_president/,"**Background**

Today, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)

This is a two-part question. 

**Goals?**

First, what are the goals of the tariffs? 

In the announcement, Trump said, ""We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers."" 

I can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.

The announced tariffs also claim to pursue ""fairness"" and ""rebalancing"" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?

Are those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? 

**Legality?**

My second question is about the legality of this action. 

The US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. 

In the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?

The order also claims authorities under the ""section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code."" Is today's action a covered or typical use of those extra-legislative authorities?"

It includes US government payments to countries like Serbia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia for the promotion of civil rights, gender rights, voting rights, etc. in those countries. 

Such programs are often referred to as a way for the US to project [""soft power:""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) *the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want... [through] economic and cultural influence, rather than coercion or military strength.*

One argument that often appears in commentary on this subject is that [China will supposedly swoop in and become the new ""soft power"" in these regions.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/29/congress-shutdown-us-china-ccp-soft-power-competition-biden-xi-jinping-beijing/)

My question is, what actual tangible benefits is the US getting from ""soft power"" in Cambodia or Serbia? In what ways does the US having soft power in those countries directly benefit American taxpayers? Does it provide a good return on the [billions of dollars](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/06/what-the-data-says-about-us-foreign-aid/) the US pays for it? 

I should clarify, I am asking for a realpolitik answer that considers tangible benefits for US tax payers, not a moral answer (""it's a nice ethical thing to fund""). 

Although many online articles explain the virtues and benefits of cultural soft power (exported Film, TV, music, pop-culture), I am struggling to find a definitive answer on the benefits of the types of programmes that Musk is apparently uncovering."

Moreover, areas with higher population density logically take longer to process their ballots and they [tend to lean left,](https://www.econlib.org/why-are-there-zero-republican-mega-cities/) so [late shifts leftwards are quite common.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_shift_\(politics\))
* Based on the [polling,](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) this could be [**one of the closest races** in the last 60 years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/closest-presidential-race-harris-trump/index.html) Don't let anyone tell you it should be a landslide just because they're immersed in communities, social circles, or media silos that unflappably support one side. It's a big country. Just because someone only knows people who support one of the candidates does not mean that candidate will win.
* Polling is an inexact art and **discrepancies between polling and voting are normal.** Donald Trump has [outperformed his polling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/why-election-polls-were-wrong-in-2016-and-2020-and-whats-changing.html) in both his previous campaigns. Democrats have [outperformed their polling](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248599739/abortion-democrats-independents-republicans-voting-2024-election) since the Dobbs decision overturned *Roe v. Wade.* We do not know who will win.
* Similarly, betting odds and prediction markets are [**not reliable** indicators of outcome.](https://time.com/7095708/financial-scam-political-prediction-election/) Their [lines shift based on the incoming bets,](https://quantian.substack.com/p/market-prices-are-not-probabilities) not probabilities. (We [discussed this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1g1fg2j/discrepancy_between_polling_numbers_and_betting/) a few weeks ago.)
* [**There will be legal challenges**, likely from both campaigns.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/election-lawsuits-trump-harris/index.html) It's common for campaigns to challenge issues they feel were not handled properly. Some challenges have already been filed and there will assuredly be others up until and after the polls have closed. This is not unusual, though given the political climate, the volume may be higher this year. More claims does not indicate malfeasance or unreliability in the system.
* **Legal challenges are not the same as ""election denialism,""** which can be [defined as](https://reason.com/volokh/2022/08/29/three-reforms-to-protect-democracy-from-election-denialism/) a willingness ""to deny *the lawfully determined outcome* of an election."" If a candidate is unwilling to accept the results *after* the challenges have been filed and adjudicated, *that* is denialism.
* **There may be recounts and runoff elections** in some races. [Recounts](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_recount_laws_and_procedures_in_the_50_states) are triggered by small margins of victory and/or successful recount requests, [depending on the jurisdiction.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/recount-laws-provisions-swing-states-trump-harris-election-rcna175476) There's no such thing as a runoff election in the presidential race, but in some states, there may be runoffs for other offices, depending on the margin of victory.
* The voting age population of the country has been rising every year for over a century, which means that if turnout rates are consistent, [more people vote in each successive election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections) Based on national polling, each major party candidate is projected to garner around 80 million votes this year. And if turnout is high, even the losing candidate could set a new record for most votes received.
* The [electoral college system](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-does-the-electoral-college-work) decides who wins, not the popular vote.
* Some election laws have changed since 2020. The [Electoral Count Act was revised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Reform_and_Presidential_Transition_Improvement_Act_of_2022) to clarify the role of the Vice President in the process. Quite a few [state laws have changed as well,](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/political-science-marc-meredith-voting-law-changes-since-2020) some more restrictive and some more expansive of the franchise.
* **Beware disinformation.** Social media, assisted by generative A.I., is being used, mostly by foreign adversaries, to undermine confidence in our elections and to stoke discord, so as to pit Americans against each other. Past incidents have been [investigated and proven.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4952349-ai-generated-deepfakes-threaten-election/) Expect even [more in the future.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6dxogtpHTk)
* Among the public, [confidence in election administration](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/24/views-of-2024-election-administration-and-confidence-in-vote-counts/) is slightly higher than in the last couple cycles, but still considerably below historical norms. Among some election experts, however, [confidence is high.](https://time.com/7096453/election-2024-security/) Here's [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7upNGzjg40) with some of them.

The point of all this is that we should expect some degree of controversy and we may not know the final results for a while. Strap in, monitor reliable sources like [AP News,](https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024) and be patient.

Why was unilateral action taken in mid 2024 but not earlier? Was it a purely altruistic belief in immigration? A reaction to being against whatever Trump said or did?"
"What percentage of the US population would need to be covered by a single-payer healthcare system for it to be cheaper per person than private insurance?

Here's an example of a source that makes this claim: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8572548/

The source I linked assumes that every American would be covered by such a system. What if this were not the case? What percentage of the population would need to be covered by such a system for its cost to break even with the cost for the same number of people to buy private insurance?

Is there anything stopping a state-by-state initiative for a single-payer healthcare system that's similar in design to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (in that it has no effect until the critical threshold is reached)? States would individually vote on legislation to establish a single-payer healthcare system, but the system would not go into effect until enough people would be covered by it to ensure that it will be cheaper than private insurance."

What's the case for and against birthright citizenship?,nosecohn,/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1i6fb8r/whats_the_case_for_and_against_birthright/,"**Background**

The *jus soli* form of birthright citizenship is the principle that [a person's citizenship is dictated by the location of their birth.](https://dictionary.justia.com/jus-soli) In the United States and many other countries, the concept is carried over from [British common law.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jus-soli) 

However, many people born in the US, such as enslaved people, were denied citizenship until [the 14th Amendment formally codified the right](https://www.usconstitution.net/14th-amendment-birthright-citizenship/) in 1868. Thirty years later, the [Supreme Court ruling in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._wong_kim_ark) expanded to include the US-born children of foreigners. 

On the first day of his second stint in office, President Trump issued an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) declaring future people born in the US will not be considered citizens if their mother isn't a lawful permanent resident, unless the father is a citizen or lawful permanent resident.

**Questions**

* What's the case for and against the type of territorial citizenship the administration is seeking to limit here?
* What evidence supports the need to make this change?
* Is there evidence that people granted *jus soli* citizenship in the 127 years since *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* have been a net detriment or benefit to the country?
* The cited executive order claims that its interpretation of the law is not new, but if that were the case, it seems there would be no need for an executive order, so what is it changing?
* Does the executive branch have the power to change the interpretation of a law in this way?"

I understand that it’s illegal for US political parties to accept financial donations from foreign interests. I understand that Labour are saying there is no financial donations here - the volunteers pay for their own flights, and accommodation is provided for free by Democrats.

But what I’m really interested in, is whether this kind of thing happens every election cycle, or whether it’s unusual. Do Labour always send volunteers? Do the Tories ever send volunteers to campaign for the Republicans? Have the Tories ever sent volunteers specifically to campaign for Trump, either in this election cycle or the two previous ones?"

Thinking about leaving the left. Nervous.,puffusedrest,/r/Republican/comments/1nokgbl/thinking_about_leaving_the_left_nervous/,"Hi everyone! I hope its okay for me to post here since I am actually not a republican. I have been a leftist for about 8 years now but I have been shifting further to the right without realizing it. Issues like abortion, and trans rights have been big ones for me that I have disagreed with the far left and have moved further right on. 

Recently though I have become disenfranchised with the left in general, and the catalyst for that was the Charlie Kirk assassination. Prior to his death I REALLY disliked Charlie. I hated what ""I thought"" he stood for, but after he died i was appalled by the reaction of the left. I think people actually celebrating was a small percentage of the left, but the general opinion from basically everyone i know on the left was AT BEST ""I don't condone violence but he had it coming"". No he didn't. That's ridiculous. What happened is horrifying for him and his family. 

Well then after his death as I looked more into Charlie with an open mind I found out he actually isn't a piece of garbage. I still disagree with a much of what he says, but I agree with A LOT more than I thought, and even when I dont agree I think he is a well meaning good person. 

This whole thing had forced me to face what I believe. I have already independently been going on a faith transition as well. I left the mormon church when I joined the left and now I am starting to become open to mainstream Christianity. The transitions in my beliefs felt like they weren't connected as they were happening but I think that probably isn't the case anymore. 

Anyway, that brings me to posting here. I am kinda nervous about this and wishing my views weren't changing. I felt a lot of judgement leaving my church and leaving the right, but when I think about leabing the left i worry about facing a lot more judgement. If I actually became a conservative I feel like I would be a closeted conservative. I dunno. I just wanted people on the right to talk to about this as I figure it out. Also if any of you are based in Utah I would like to meet young adult conservatives (ideally non mormon)."
