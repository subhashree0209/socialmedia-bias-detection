Democrat supporters refuse to discuss or accept that the Harris campaign made major mistakes that turned off voters or made voters not want to come out and vote.

They seem to take accepting responsibility for failure as an endorsement of trumps behavior, which is odd.

Edit 2: The fact that so many of my fellow Harris supporters are asking for what constitutes a losing strategy is hilarious. ""What mistakes?"". 10million fewer democrats didn't decide to randomly not vote. 

Mistakes such as:
- She should have distanced herself from Biden
- She should have made stronger points about improving the economy
- less celebrity endorsement, more working class town halls
- saying no substantial  difference on Gaza which alienated Arab Michigan voters 
- focusing on illegals immigration before it became a concern to her campaign late in the game 
- her weird laughter and lack of charisma(aka Howard Dean scream, despite being a silly issue did bother people )
- cozying up to billionaires and receiving donations from big pharma which, as the NYT said, limited her ability to criticize those groups 

""Scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds"" is so true.

Lots of willful ignorance, congrats guys you've distanced moderates in this thread. When they called him Drumpf I rolled my eyes. Just like when they thought ""weird"" was the kryptonite. Maybe name calling isn't the answer?

I don't know if I'll vote dem again when the party I've voted for since I was first able to during Obama's second term has changed. Maybe independent🤔

One of the top commments called the Harris campaign ""flawless""😭.

Trump was convicted in court for hiding a hush money payment to Stormie Daniels, a porn star, that he had sex with while married. He also lost a defamation case brought up by E. Jean Carroll, when he denied allegations that he sexually assaulted her. So US courts have officially ruled that Trump is a rapist and buys prostitutes, exactly the allegations against Gaetz. And yet Gaetz is drummed out of Congress for his actions by his own party.

I'm sure this question has come up before and has been answered, but I feel like the time is right to bring it up again.

Edit: After examining all the answers, these are the best ones that made sense to me:

1. Trump isn't affected by shame, and he deflects all his attacks by turning the mirror on his opponents, who are often slightly if not fully corrupt as well. This justifies him in the eyes of his supporters. Furthermore, he makes himself such a controversial character that the media and the government have a hard time keeping up with him to hold him accountable.
2. He's also a powerhouse in the GOP now, and others who don't have quite as big of a backing are easily thrown under the bus by the party.

In summary: American politics are f*cked.

Edit 2: Other answers I see.

""MAGA is a cult""

While I don't deny the fervor of his base, especially considering some of the replies that I'm getting, I do not believe that the establishment GOP sees him that way, else Gaetz would've never run into such an issue.

""The system is rigged against him and people see through it.""

If so, how was he able to delay all the election interference cases, and the sentencing on the Stormie Daniels case, against him until past the election, and then win the election? Why would a system that is rigged against him even allow him the chance to be reelected?

""He didn't pay Stormie Daniels for sex, he just paid her to stay silent."" 

And 

""He isn't guilty of raping E. Jean Carroll, he's guilty of defaming her.""

You're making excuses for him and proving my point, honestly.

""Trump was elected, not appointed.""

Yes, but he's still subject to impeachment, which he was able to get out of twice, clearly because the GOP sees that he wins elections.

""Gaetz was a smokescreen.""

Then why did Gaetz withdraw before the Senate even began the confirmation process? If Gaetz was just supposed to distract people from his other picks, then he should've stayed in."

I have read almost all the responses. A vast majority are saying that the controversy revolves around whether it is constitutional to guarantee citizenship to people born in the country.

My follow-up question to the vast majority is: if there were enough votes to amend the Constitution to end certain birthrights, such as the ones Trump wants to end, would it no longer be controversial?"

Republicans / Trump voters: What values do you think the Democrats are trying to attack?,[deleted],/r/Askpolitics/comments/1gzms3i/republicans_trump_voters_what_values_do_you_think/,"For the life of me I don’t know what posts / comments about democratic persecution of republicans could be talking about besides “Don’t use the R word.”

From my perspective, the democratic positions are “be kind to people who are different from you” (trans people, gay people, etc), while the Republican positions are specifically geared towards limiting individual freedoms and expressions.

I’m just so confused. What exactly are the democrats trying to take away, or dismantle, or rob republicans of?

**Edit:**

Thanks for all the responses!

Except for the ones that don’t even attempt to discuss this, or the Democrats out there telling me what they think about this question. I don’t really care why you think they voted for Trump. Wasn’t the question and the question wasn’t for you!

I went for a long time but I can’t go forever so I’m taking a break. Here’s a short summary so far:

Seems like for the most part the Trump voters who answered didn’t vote for Trump because they disagreed with democratic policies or because they supported Trump. It appears that responders voted for Trump because they were tired of being bitched at and told they were wrong online.

Some had other more salient points like: 

“Gay marriage is an attack on the nuclear family.”

“Trans women shouldn’t be able to play sports with women.”

“Donald Trump will fix inflation.”

“DEI is bad.”

Some I asked for clarity. Some I bitched at and told them they were wrong.

Anyway, it’s so fucking sad and morally questionable to vote for an adjudicated rapist because somebody called you mean online.

Grow some skin.

"How can the notion that Trump ""can't be bought"" be reconciled with his relationship with Elon Musk?",[deleted],/r/Askpolitics/comments/1hdbwze/how_can_the_notion_that_trump_cant_be_bought_be/,"A frequent argument I've heard in favor of Donald Trump as a president and presidential candidate is the notion that, unlike common politicians, he ""can't be bought"". This idea generally suggests that because he's so rich and successful, no special interests can influence him to change his policy using bribery or lobbying.

I still occasionally hear this argument, both for Trump and as a justification for his appointment of mainly ultra-wealthy cabinet members. But how can this claim still be rationalized, in light of Elon Musk's highly publicized patronage of Trump's 2024 campaign? Musk, the world's richest man, poured hundreds of millions into Trump's campaign, and was rewarded for it with an seat in Trump's government where he can influence policy relevant to his own interests, and material changes to Trump's policies.

Trump himself flat-out said that he had ""no choice"" but to change his stance on electronic vehicles because of Musk's support. This seems like exactly the type of ""being bought"" that Trump's supporters still tend to claim he's immune to. Is there any distinction to be made here, or is this just pure hypocrisy/cognitive dissonance?"

A shockingly contentious public demonstration occurred in the White House Oval Office with Trump and Vance together telling Zelensky to sign the mineral deal and that was the only way to have U.S. support.

“You’re not really in a good position right now.” Trump said. “You’re gambling with World War III.” At one moment, Vance accused Zelensky of being “disrespectful” toward his American hosts. “You’re not acting all that thankful,” Trump added. “Have you said ‘thank you’ once?” Vance asked Zelensky.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” the US president said, adding later: “If we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it will be pretty.”

Zelensky has often said thanks including earlier during the conference. Zelensky also expressed some reservations and need for further discussions before any deal could be signed referring to security guarantees.  However, shortly after the conference it was reported Zelensky had left without any deal. 

Trump noted Zelensky was not ready for peace, but that he could come back when he was.

How is Trump Getting Away with Everything?,SpiritFlimsy7446,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1jekmok/how_is_trump_getting_away_with_everything/," I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.

I get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?

For context:  
📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.  
📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.  
📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.  
📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to ""find"" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.

📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous. 

📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.

📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office

It seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation. But is the American legal system really that broken, or is there some higher-level political game being played here?

But, she continued, “because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.”

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,Spiderwig144,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gi79lt/republican_senate_leader_mitch_mcconnell/,"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

Should we be seriously concerned that Trump is mentally unwell?,damndirtyape,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1jnuxws/should_we_be_seriously_concerned_that_trump_is/,"I know this title is going to sound like a partisan attack to some. But, I'm wondering if we should be seriously considering the possibility that the US president is an older man who has experienced notable cognitive decline and is behaving erratically. 

When Trump is discussed, you will occasionally here people using the term ""sanewashing"". This means acting like Trump's ideas are saner than they really are. His supporters want to believe he's playing 4-D chess. His opponents want to believe he has sinister intentions. But, could it be that his behavior legitimately does not make sense because he is unwell? 

The man is currently threatening Canada, Greenland, and Panama. On the campaign trail, there was no mention of the idea that he might try to forcibly expand US territory. No one voted for that. I don't think his own party is on board with these ideas. These ideas seem legitimately crazy. 

Not that long ago, he was calling Zelensky a dictator because there haven't been elections. Later, when questioned, he said ""Did I say that?"". Now, he is apparently angry at Putin for questioning Zelensky's legitimacy. Is he seriously confused? 

Some people want to believe that Trump is attempting to implement madman theory. This was a political strategy popularized by Nixon who wanted US adversaries to believe that he was capable of anything. But...could it be that Trump is legitimately losing his mind? 

There's an argument that the world has a problem with aging leaders. Famously, people began having doubts about Biden's cognitive ability. There also might be reason to question Putin's mental state. When asked to explain the war, he begins talking about medieval history. And now, the US is led by a man in his 70's whose behavior might be described as erratic. 

I don't want to be agist, but it’s an established medical fact that older people experience brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. In the US, we've seen examples of older politicians (like Diane Feinstein) who noticeably decline while in office. There's a problem with people continuing to elect well known incumbents, not realizing that they are losing it as they get older. 

Should we be seriously worried that the current US president is cognitively declining? And can the US system handle that? The US presidency is a very powerful office. Does the government self-destruct if the president loses their mind?"

That decision, Smith’s report states, left open unresolved legal issues that would likely have required another trip to the Supreme Court in order for the case to have moved forward.

Is the American population beginning to turn on Trump?,eh_steve_420,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1npqsfb/is_the_american_population_beginning_to_turn_on/,"Several prominent Anti-Trump voices have 
recently publicly stated that they think that the nation has hit a turning point because of the recent events in the past week.  

Robert Reich expressed his views in a  substack article entitled ""The Sleeping Giant Is Awakening"" (It won't let me link a sub stack article, you'll have to Google it).  Reich argues that Trump’s blatant authoritarian behavior over the course of a week — suing the New York Times, attacking reporters, cheering censorship, threatening to pull network licenses, and demanding prosecutions of rivals — has finally gone too far for many Americans. The backlash, seen most clearly in the massive Disney boycott and Trump’s falling poll numbers, shows the public is no longer just grumbling but actively resisting. Reich believes this marks the “sleeping giant” of American democracy awakening, as it has in past crises like McCarthyism, civil rights, Vietnam, and Watergate.

Historian Heather Cox Richardson agreed with Reich in her semi-weekly [Politics Chat live stream](https://youtu.be/AQ2ZxeneQrk), citing similar examples while also emphasizing that his poll numbers are trending downward — including approval on his performance with the economy, immigration, among other areas.  She also cites how several notable right-wing figures used their platform to speak out against Trump's infringements on the First Amsnsmen— noting that the struggle is becoming the American people vs. an increasingly authoritarian government, rather than left vs. right.

President Trump has proposed sending US citizens to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison. Would the Supreme Court likely allow this?,damndirtyape,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1jzf345/president_trump_has_proposed_sending_us_citizens/,"In recent months, the Trump administration has begun a controversial deportation policy that involves sending immigrants to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). This facility is a maximum-security prison that holds tens of thousands of suspected gang members. 

CECOT has drawn criticism from international human rights organizations. Prisoners are often held without formal charges. They are denied access to legal counsel, and they have almost no contact with the outside world. They are confined in overcrowded cells and movement is heavily restricted. They also must remain silent almost constantly. The facility lacks proper ventilation and temperatures inside can reportedly exceed 90 degrees. Medical care is limited, and deaths in custody have been reported. Observers describe the conditions as severe and dehumanizing. 

The Trump administration has defended its policy by citing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime statute that allows the detention or removal of foreign nationals. In one high-profile case, a Maryland resident named Kilmar Abrego García was mistakenly sent to CECOT, despite legal protections that had been granted to him. The Supreme Court later ordered the administration to “facilitate” his return. But, officials have argued that this only requires them to permit his reentry if he is released. President Bukele has declined to release him, and the administration has not pursued further action. 

More recently, President Trump has proposed extending this approach to U.S. citizens. In a meeting with President Bukele, he stated, “Home-growns are next. You gotta build about five more places.” He later added, “These are bad people. These are killers, gang members, and we are absolutely looking at sending them there.” ""You think there’s a special category of person? They’re as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too. I’m all for it.” 

In recent history, the Supreme Court has often shown a willingness to uphold the actions of President Trump. In light of that record, would it likely authorize the transfer of U.S. citizens to this El Salvador prison? Are there sufficient legal protections in place to prevent this, and is there a real danger that President Trump could begin sending US citizens to this prison?"

Why do Trump and Musk keep pushing the Social Security fraud narrative?,KensofarEon,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1j4h36s/why_do_trump_and_musk_keep_pushing_the_social/,"&gt;[150-year-olds are not receiving Social Security payments ](https://www.marketplace.org/2025/02/20/150-year-olds-are-not-receiving-social-security-payments/)

&gt;This week, he tweeted a spreadsheet showing how many people in the system are in each age bracket. [More than 1.3 million ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891350795452654076)people are marked as between the ages of 150 and 159, while almost 2,800 are listed as 200 and older. 

&gt;“If you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,” Trump said. 

&gt;But data on the Social Security Administration’s website shows [that only about 89,000 people over the age of 99 ](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/benefits/primaries.html)are receiving payments on the basis of their earnings. And there are [only an estimated 108,000 centenarians](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/09/us-centenarian-population-is-projected-to-quadruple-over-the-next-30-years/) living in the U.S., according to United Nations data, while the oldest known human being lived [to the age of 122](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/longevity-expert-3-reasons-the-worlds-oldest-person-lived-to-122.html). 

&gt;Wired magazine reported that the number of people in the 150-year age bracket [may have to do with the programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/) used by the SSA, known as COBOL, or the Common Business Oriented Language. The 65-year-old system [can still be found at government agencies, businesses and financial institutions. ](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/the-65-year-old-computer-system-at-the-heart-of-american-business/)

&gt;Basically, when there is a missing or incomplete birthdate, COBOL defaults to a reference point. The most common is May 20, 1875, when countries around the world [attended a convention on metric standards](https://usma.org/laws-and-bills/metric-convention-of-1875). Someone born in 1875 would be 150 in 2025, which is why entries with missing and incomplete birthdates will default to that age, Wired explained. 

What's the strategy here? Are they claiming fraud to justify program wide cuts to Social Security? Or will they claim they reduced Social Security fraud to highlight the effectiveness of DOGE?

Edit:

Thank you kindly for the discussion, I appreciate everyone's viewpoints and answers to my questions.

My personal beliefs are the status quo is taking us down the wrong path, we need to change to a more empathetic and environmentally conscious future. We need to do this nonviolently and inclusively, and the more we are active about sharing the facts the better off we will be. We need people to understand that billionaires are only there because the workers are sacrificing a majority of their labor value to keep a job and collect Social Security. If you take SS away, just like taking away pensions or losing a major investment into a stock market dive—there will be public outrage. We must rise above the violence and  always remain civil whenever possible. The pardoning of the J6 folks was a slippery slope to the protection of democracy, essentially condoning their actions because their leader is now in power... that is a threat to democracy if I have ever seen one.  That said, never be afraid to rise up from those who seek to tread on you...

I highly recommend the film Civil War from 2024.  Not only is it a cinematographic masterpiece but also serves as a borderline absurdist take on the USA if say, a third Trump term was introduced...."

Trump reiterated today his goal for the Canada tariffs—annexation. What is the likely outcome of this?,invariantspeed,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ig9hul/trump_reiterated_today_his_goal_for_the_canada/,"He posted this on “truth social” today:

&gt; We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!

*(I am not linking because I know many subs are censoring links to “truth social” and twitter. It will be the first result if you google it.)*

In summary, he asserts:
1. That the US doesn’t need Canada
2. That Canada is on US-supplied life support
3. That shutting down trade with Canada will kill the country and allow it to be annexed

I assume this is why he is currently refusing phone calls from the Canadian government. He doesn’t have demands for Canada. The demand *is* Canada. But *the question* is where this goes politically.

Donald Trump's MAGA seems to be splitting on the Epstein files more than on any previous controversy that he was involved in. Why is this the trigger?

Other influencers and appointees are defending the Trump administration, causing what appears to be a schism in the ""MAGAsphere"". Donald Trump has posted several tweets and made comments in other venues that indicate he wishes this to go entirely away, but instead, the story seems to be gaining traction.

**Why?** What about THIS EVENT seems to be blowing up MAGA more than others? Are numerous media reports on the fraction exaggerated? Why did this trigger a schism when so many of Trump's previous questionable actions have not? Will this go away, or will it continue to build into a full split in the loose ""MAGAsphere""?

For background, in February 27. [US DOJ's appointed head Pam Bondi officially released some of the information in the Epstein files as a ""first phase"" and ordered more to be inspected for possible release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-releases-first-phase-declassified-epstein-files).

That information, presumably including a ""celebrity list' that many right-wing social media sources claimed contained the names of many democratic politicians, was not released. Recently, the DOJ and FBI jointly released questionably video footage of Epstein's cell as ""evidence"" that Epstein committed suicide and was not murdered, and claimed that this ""celebrity list"", does not exist.  This has infuriated FBI deputy director Dan Bongino who has accused FBI head Bondi of over-promising and under-delivering on her interactions with this list, and leading to some influencers calling loudly for it to be released while others defend Trump.

The ability of a private citizen to consolidate power in this way raises serious concerns about **democratic oversight, separation of powers, and national security risks**.

Historically, authoritarian figures have used legal mechanisms to **sidestep traditional checks and balances**, and critics argue that we’re seeing a similar pattern here.

“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump [said](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/bFORNS0mvNOxmr9cbwwpUJRzq-pofVnRhYN3vHJKQdeiFjefDAKwDpPowHng3r_kHNX-RDMkd2KrzETglXlCPsGi_Wk?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1706.4) last year.

Journalists who decline to identify the sources of leaked information would also face imprisonment, Trump said.

When right-wing radio host Glenn Beck asked Trump if he would lock up his opponents in a second term, Trump [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lywHT5uH71M&amp;t=124s), “The answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.”

Legal experts said that there are few guardrails preventing Trump from pursuing his plans to prosecute opponents and noted that Trump pressured the Department of Justice to investigate rivals during his first term. In about a dozen cases, the Justice Department followed through and initiated investigations, according to one [analysis](https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/).

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?
